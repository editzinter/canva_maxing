# Initial Concept
A graphic design or document editor built with Next.js and Fabric.js, allowing users to create, edit, and export visual content.

# Product Vision
To build a web-based graphic design platform that rivals the experience and feature set of Canva. The goal is to bridge the gap between professional-grade precision and "zero learning curve" simplicity, making high-quality design accessible to both seasoned designers and small business owners.

# Core Objectives
1.  **Canva-Level Parity:** aggressively implement features and polish UX to match the industry standard (Canva).
2.  **Editor Stability & UX:** Prioritize fixing existing bugs in the canvas interaction and "multi-page" functionality.
3.  **Hybrid Workflow:** Offer a seamless experience that caters to quick content creation (templates/media) and deep customization (advanced typography/layout).

# Target Audience
*   **Professional Designers:** Seeking a lightweight, accessible tool without sacrificing layout precision.
*   **Casual Users & Small Businesses:** Needing to create marketing materials and social media content quickly using pre-built assets.

# Key Features & Priorities
*   **Editor Overhaul:** Address critical UX gaps and bugs in the current editor interface, specifically regarding canvas interactions and page management.
*   **Rich Media Ecosystem:** Integrate a library of stock photos, icons (leveraging the existing SVG assets), and templates.
*   **Advanced Typography:** Implement robust text tools including custom fonts, spacing, effects, and potentially curved text.
