# Product Guidelines: "Intentional Minimalism"

## Design Philosophy: Avant-Garde Minimalist
We reject the standard "template" look. Our aesthetic is a fusion of avant-garde experimentation and strict Swiss precision. Every element must have a calculated purpose.

## Visual Identity & Typography
*   **Grid-Strict & Swiss:** Layouts are governed by rigorous mathematical grids. Alignment must be absolute.
*   **Neo-Grotesk Priority:** Use clean, neutral typefaces (e.g., Inter, Geist) but leverage size, weight, and whitespace to create a bold, high-contrast hierarchy.
*   **Color Palette:** Primarily high-contrast (Deep blacks, pure whites) with intentional, minimal pops of color only to indicate action or emphasis.

## UI/UX Engineering
*   **Fluid & Context-Aware:** Tools and panels should appear only when contextually relevant to the current selection on the canvas. The default state is an immersive, empty workspace.
*   **Invisible UX:** Interactions must be characterized by seamless micro-animations and transitions. The goal is a "frictionless" experience where the user focuses on their design, not the interface.
*   **Intentional Whitespace:** Whitespace is not empty; it is a structural element used to create focus and elegance.

## Interaction Principles
*   **Micro-Interactions:** Focus on the "feel" of dragging, resizing, and clicking. Use subtle easing and transitions to provide non-intrusive feedback.
*   **Canvas Centrality:** The canvas is the hero. All other UI elements are secondary and should minimize their visual footprint (low-opacity, thin lines, or hidden states).
